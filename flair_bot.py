"""

Starting August 2015 reddit will require all logins to be made through OAuth. 
In order to log in through OAuth you'll need to follow a few simple steps 
(see https://github.com/SmBe19/praw-OAuth2Util/blob/master/OAuth2Util/README.md#reddit-config)

The first time you run the script a browser will open and you'll have to log into the account to authorize the app, 
if you don't do this the script will not write any tokens and it simply won't work. Message 
/u/zzqw- if you need help with this.

OAuth changes made by /u/zzqw- + /u/GoldenSights
OAUth2Util.py by /u/SmBe19 (https://github.com/SmBe19/praw-OAuth2Util)
